            Recommended way: RVGL Launcher
          %p
            With this program you can download and manage custom content for the game with just a few clicks. Go to the following link to download it:
            <a href="https://re-volt.gitlab.io/rvgl-launcher/#download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Re-Volt Launcher</a>
          %p
            When you open the launcher for the first time, you will be able to select the folder where the game will be installed and the \"Game Preset\",
            in this option we recommend that you select Original.
          %h4
            Classic way
          %p
            Enter the following <a href="https://re-volt.io/downloads/game" target="_blank">link</a>
            and choose the version of the game for your operating system (Windows, Android, Linux or macOS).
          %p
            When the download is finished, unzip the file in the folder of your choice and run RVGL to start playing.

            In the case of Android, when you try to run the game installer
            (click this <a href= "https://distribute.re-volt.io/releases/rvgl_full_android_original.apk" target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> to download)
            you need to grant permissions to install external applications.
          %p
            After accepting the permission and installing the game the app can be opened normally from the app drawer of your phone.
          %p
            ⚠️ The Steam version of Re-Volt is not compatible to play online races, since it is an obsolete version. For this and other reasons we <b>do not</b> recommend its purchase.

            Perform the steps of the classic method, only that on Android you need a file manager capable of decompressing ZIP files,
            you can search in the Play Store applications such as ZArchiver, RAR or others if your phone does not incorporate a file manager.
          %p
            Inside the file manager go to the Downloads folder (or wherever you have downloaded the packs) and unzip them in the RVGL folder that is in the internal memory.
