  ## **#{t('privacy.title')}**

  #{ORG::NAME} collects and stores information about users in very few ways:

  - All text sent through our public Discord chats. Only Administrators and Developers have access to these records,
   which we use to investigate reports of harassment and other rule violations.
  - If you choose to donate towards the website's development effort, your payment information is sent directly to
   PayPal. We do not store payment information on our own servers.
  - Nothing else! We value privacy!

  In general, #{ORG::NAME} collects user information only for the purpose of improving our services. Sensitive
  information is only visible to our own staff, and only to those staff who need it to do their job.
